# learning-os
bro claims he wants to learn about os but programs in python 

## Reason for doing this
This is my second time going through OStep, yet I can't quite seem to get my fundamentals down. Must be reason for unemployability. booboo. Will add design decisions in the future once I get a formal idea of how to model this and how far I wish to go.

Todo:
- ~~Implement I/O simulation~~
- Improve logging for monitoring of various components
- Implement MLFQ
- Further away type of goals include: Simulating memory management and file systems (If I even get that far)
